# C-Cgol
A non-interactional Conway's Game of Life written in C for the X11 graphics manager

# Getting Started
There's really nothing special here. Just another game of Cgol.
## Oh, there is one thing:
running the binary from your terminal (prefered way, unless you want to kill the simulation with htop lol) you may execute the script with random characters in stdin.

Example:

`./cgol <<<random`

produces a rondomly generated grid.
